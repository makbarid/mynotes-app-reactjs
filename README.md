All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```


## Setup

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/makbarmaulana/mynotes-app-reactjs.git
cd mynotes-app-reactjs
npm install
```

This may take a few minutes.


## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser.
